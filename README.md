## Credit Scoring Business Understanding

### Basel II and Interpretability

The Basel II Accord's emphasis on internal risk measurement directly mandates interpretable, well-documented models. In the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach, banks must demonstrate that their Probability of Default (PD) models are conceptually sound, statistically validated, and transparent to regulators. A "black-box" model cannot be adequately validated, creating **model risk**—the risk of incorrect capital calculations leading to insolvency or regulatory penalty. The 2025 ECB guide explicitly requires that even advanced ML models remain "adequately explainable."

### Proxy Variables in Absence of Default Labels

When true default data is unavailable, a correlated proxy variable (e.g., 60+ days past due) must be used. This introduces critical business risks:

- **Survival bias**: Models only observe accepted applicants, not rejected ones
- **Definition mismatch**: Proxy may capture temporary delinquency, not true default
- **Proxy discrimination**: Even non-protected variables can become proxies for protected characteristics (e.g., Morse 2020 showed "non-civil marriage" correlated with gender after controlling for risk factors)

### Interpretability vs. Performance Trade-offs

| Aspect | Logistic Regression (WoE) | Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Interpretability** | High (intrinsic) | Low (post-hoc only) |
| **Typical Gini** | ~0.65 | ~0.68 |
| **Regulatory Acceptance** | Preferred | Conditional |
| **Risk** | Lower compliance, higher prediction error | Higher compliance, lower prediction error |

**Decision framework**: Use Logistic Regression with WoE for regulated portfolios where transparency is paramount. Use XGBoost as a challenger model or for portfolios where even marginal Gini improvements justify additional validation burden.

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd credit-risk-model

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train model
python -m src.train

# Run API
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src
Using Docker
CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow (ci.yml) performs:

    Linting (flake8, black)

    Unit tests with coverage

    Security scanning (bandit)

    Docker build validation

    Automated deployment on main branch
